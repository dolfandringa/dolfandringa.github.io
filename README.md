This is the github code for the website of dolf andringa, currently hosted on allican.be through github pages. 
The website is created using jekyll and a modified version of the Strata theme from html5up.net.

The master branch contains the static HTML while the jekyll branch contains the jekyll code/markdown files. 
This separation is done because the github jekyll implementation doesn't allow the use of plugins. So I chose
to build the jekyll files locally into the master branch, which then gets pushed to github, while the jekyll files
are still managed in the same account on github.
