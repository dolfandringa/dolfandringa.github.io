  <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

  <p>I am a software engineer with many years of experience and a strong affinity for IoT and hardware development. My main languages are Python, Typescript and embedded C, using TDD and CI/CD practices. I am very hands-on, and eager to jump into new challenges. My many years of experience have given me great breadth of knowledge, without sacrificing technical depth when necessary. As solutions architect, I love understanding problems properly both on the technical side and from a user’s perspective. First and foremost I am an engineer, but am also very aware of the business consequences of engineering choices. In my last role at Therma, I designed the LoRaWAN IoT infrastructure for first their refrigeration monitoring platform, followed by the full back-end, machine learning pipeline, IoT architecture and hardware prototype integration for their energy product. These two led to them getting their $19M Series A funding, and resulted in two provisional patent applications.</p>
