  <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

  <p>I am a software engineer with many years of experience and a strong affinity for IoT, hardware and embedded development. My main languages are Python, Typescript and embedded C, using TDD and CI/CD practices. I am very hands-on, and eager to jump into new challenges. My many years of experience have given me great breadth of knowledge, without sacrificing technical depth when necessary. As solutions architect, I love understanding problems properly both on the technical side and from a user’s perspective. I love working as an engineer first, but am very aware of the business consequences of engineering choices. In my last role at Therma, I was was focused on new product development focused on commercial refrigeration, HVAC and the energy markets, which involved hardware development and designing and implementing a ML and backend infrastructure, all of which I took the technical lead on. My most essential skill in all of this is to be able to quickly analyze and understand a problem, both technical and practically. Once you do, solutions usually follow logically.</p>

The applications were implemented in Python, Java, and PostgreSQL using the Turbogears framework and a web-mapping application implemented in OpenLayers/GeoExt/Geoserver/PostGIS. Data extraction, abstraction and interpretation were enormous challenges as data had to be extracted from 7 different IT systems from different companies, and were often very large and badly documented and had grown organically over many years.
