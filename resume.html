The application consists of data extraction, transport, anonymisation, encryption and reporting layers implemented in Python, Java, and PostgreSQL. The reporting front-end for clients was a web-application written in Turbogears and a web-mapping application implemented in OpenLayers/GeoExt/Geoserver/PostGIS. Data extraction, abstraction and interpretation were enormous challenges as data had to be extracted from 7 different IT systems from different companies, and were often very large and badly documented and had grown organically over many years.
