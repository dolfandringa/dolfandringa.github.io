<td><p><strong>Technology and conservation consultant</strong></p>
<p>Still based in the Philippines, I now work as an independent contractor and consultant. I implement and develop technical solutions. This ranges from software development and implementation, Spatial Data Infrastructure implementation and GIS and remote sensing consultancy. As my affinity with marine conservation, science and GIS is very strong, this is my primary focus area, but my skill are equally applicable elsewhere. Although my main specialty is full-stack development in Python, I am versatile and have experience in Java, C, R and other languages. I am also experienced in IT infrastructure setup and implementation and am quick in solving IT challenges.</p></td>

## Bio ##

I hold an MSc in biology from [Wageningen University](//www.wur.nl), The Netherlands. My major thesis was on mangrove ecology in Mozambique and my internship on the mangrove dwelling iguana *[Ctenosaurus bakeri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctenosaura_bakeri)* on Utila, Honduras. My minor thesis was on GIS and was a proof-of-concept on transforming 3D models from CAD programs to 3D formats usable in GIS for 3D visualisation on the web.

But well before uni I already started messing with computers, with one of my earlier accomplishments being screwing up my fathers 386XT computer by installing Windows 95 (it was running windows 3.11) and thus screwing up the harddrive drivers. Although a friend of mine fixed it, my father never trusted me with computers again.

During uni I started to teach myself web-design, system administration, Linux and later on programming. It resulted in different jobs as system administrator, and in me working as an independent contractor setting up and managing servers and networks for a few companies and later also doing programming and database work. It culminated in starting a company together with a friend that offered a business intelligence SAAS platform and consultancy for GP's and other healthcare practitioners. I was the technical brains of the company. The majority of the work concerned extracting datasets from other applications and translating big unwieldy datasets, into real-life questions and answers for healthcare providers. On the presentation side we had a reporting web-application and a GIS web-application showing geographical representations of data. As a hobby I got interested in electronics and hacking, and became a member of the hackerspace [NURDspace](//www.nurdspace.nl). After a few years my company grew to about 7 employees, by which time it was time for me to change my life and I left.

During my university years I did a fair share of travelling in the tropics and me and my wife were itching to get back into nature conservation again. So we packed our bags and left the Netherlands to go travel, volunteer and live abroad. We ran an environmental education project in Bolivia for half a year and volunteered for a marine conservation project in Cambodia. Being divers and ecologists, we wanted to work in marine conservation and found a job as science officer with [Marine Conservation Philippines](//www.marinecosnervationphilippines.org). Aside from being in charge of the conservation and scientific side of the organization I am also in charge of the technical and technological side of things. This job is very diverse and ranges from designing scientific research, marine monitoring programs, scientific data collection, management and analysis (PostgreSQL and R), setting up the spatial data infrastructure and doing all mapping and remote sensing activities, supervising interns and volunteers, consulting local government and people's organizations in their marine conservation activities and much more. On the technical side  I also managed the IT infrastructure and develop and maintain our [scientific data entry and management application /project/2016/01/04/Biodata.html].

In 2016 I decided that although there a there a lot of interesting projects I worked on at MCP, my ambitions reached further and together with my bosses I decided I would become an independent consultant. As such I will continue to work for MCP on technical projects where my skills are most valuable, but I also have my hands free to work on other projects. I realized my skills are best put to use to aid (marine) conservation and our environment by finding, implementing and developing technical and technological solutions. I am developing and implementing software and hardware solutions to aid renewable energy initiatives, aid conservation organizations in data collection, management and analysis, and facilitate marine ecosystem monitoring. In the same time period I got into close contact with one of the partners of E.A.S.T. corp, which is a really idealistic person who wants to improve our environment by implementing sustainable energy solutions. Our aims are very similar, and my technical expertise interested him. When I told him about my plans to become an independent consultant, he asked me to also join him and the other partners at E.A.S.T. corp. As our goals and ideas coincide a lot, I saw interesting opportunities to combine the work of E.A.S.T. corp and my work as independent consultant and therefore accepted. As one of the partners I am mainly responsible for implementing and developing IT solutions, technical support and R&D.

According to other people I can be quite hyperactive and passionate in my opinions (I still don't believe them though). I love to try and learn new things and am quick to understand problems and new theory. I have a very analytical mind. I love solving technical problems much more than managing and having meetings. The more difficult the problem, the more I am committed in solving it.
