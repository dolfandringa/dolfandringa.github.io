For anyone interested below you can find my resumé. Although I can't imagine anyone being interested you can also read my (not so) short [Bio](#bio).

## Bio ##

I hold an MSc in biology from [Wageningen University](http://www.wur.nl), The Netherlands. My major thesis was on mangrove ecology in Mozambique and my internship on the mangrove dwelling iguana *[Ctenosaurus bakeri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctenosaura_bakeri)* on Utila, Honduras. My minor thesis was on GIS and was a proof-of-concept on transforming 3D models from CAD programs to 3D formats usable in GIS for 3D visualisation on the web.

But well before uni I already started messing with computers, with one of my earlier accomplishments being screwing up my fathers 386XT computer by installing Windows 95 (it was running windows 3.11) and thus screwing up the harddrive drivers. Although a friend of mine fixed it, my father never trusted me with computers again.

During uni I started to teach myself webdesign, system administration, Linux and later on programming. It resulted in different jobs as system administrator, and in me working as an independent contractor setting up and managing servers and networks for a few companies and later also doing programming and database work. It culminated in starting a company together with a friend that offerd a business intellegence SAAS platform for GP's and other healthcare practitioners. I was the techincal brains of the company. The majority of the work concerned extracting datasets from other applications and translating big unwieldy datasets, into real-life questions and answers for healthcar practitioners. On the presentation side we had a reporting webapplication and a GIS webapplication showing geographical representations of data. As a hobby I got interested in electronics and hacking, and became a member of the hackerspace [NURDspace](http://www.nurdspace.nl). After a few years my company grew to about 7 employees, by which time it was time for me to change my life and I left.

During my university years I did a fair share of travelling in the tropics and me and my wife were itching to get back into nature conservation again. So we packed our bags and left the Netherlands to go travel, volunteer and live abroad. We ran an environmental education project in Bolivia for half a year and volunteered for a marine conservation project in Cambodia. Being divers and ecologists, we wanted to work in marine conservation and found a job as science officer with [Marine Conservation Philippines](http://www.marinecosnervationphilippines.org) where we are working still. Aside from being (together with my wife) in charge of the conservation and scientific side of the organisation, I also manage IT, develop and maintain our data entry application, do the data analysis in R and do GIS work for coastal management planning.

According to other people I can be quite hyperactive and passionate in my opinons (I still don't believe them though). I love to try and learn new things and am quick to understand problems and new theory. I have a very analytical mind. I love solving technical problems much more than managing and having meetings. The more difficult the problem, the more I am committed in solving it.
