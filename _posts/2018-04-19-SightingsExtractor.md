The Sightings Extractor application is a facebook app that allows conservation NGO's to organize citizen science projects where users report sightings of interesting animals to the NGO using a specific hash-tag. Sightings are taken by the app and interpreted using a machine learning algorithm that filters the useful sightings, interprets the images and reports them to a database for further scientific analysis. It makes citizen science projects much easier since users don't need to install specific apps, while the machine learning algorithm takes much work out of the hands of the conservation NGO.

## Privacy Policy
The app only uses the messages posted by users to the page, with the pre-arranged hashtag. No data will be shared or used in any way for marketing (other than Facebook does themselves). Only the posted information by the user will be used.
