Most of the activities of students is extra-curricular, but I also supervise capstone and thesis subjects. The college furthermore frequently asks my advise regarding it's research and education strategy, and I spearhead environmentally or socially relevant projects that implement technological solutions.     |

|               |I specialize in full-stack software development in Python, Angular and Ionic. I furthermore consult on geospatial and scientific data management, analysis and reporting. As my affinity with marine conservation, science and GIS is very strong, I enjoy applying my skills in this area most, but also derive a lot of satisfaction from purely technological challenges. Although my main software development specialty is full-stack web-development in Python and Angular, I am versatile and have experience in Java, C, R, PHP and other languages.     |

|2016 - present |Partner at East Solar Works           |
|               |East Solar Works is a solar company that mainly focuses on new applications of solar power. It moved from regular solar power installations to solar water pumping for municipal and rural water supplies. As one of the partners, my main responsibility is implementing ICT solutions, technical support and R&D and optimizing business processes. My previous experience in building IT solutions and as CTO of an IT company come together in this role.          |

|           |MCP is a non-profit nature conservation organization, funded by its volunteer program. It supports conservation initiatives by the local government and conservation and peoples' organizations with technical knowledge and trained manpower. My main responsibility was research and monitoring setup and execution, and supervision of interns and volunteers in those activities and coordination with stakeholders. Later on my role shifted more towards techn(olog)ical activities like data management and analysis, GIS and remote sensing activities and IT and spatial data infrastructure management. As part of the scientific monitoring program, I also developed our own data entry (web-)application in AngularJS/Python/PostgreSQL. Since I work as independent consultant, MCP is still one of my clients.         |

|           |Coordination of an environmental education project in two consecutive secondary school years, in the Bolivian Amazon. Responsibilities included design and layout (in LateX) of educational material for a field practical and ecology course for secondary schools, and the coordination of the project with schools, teachers, directors, the municipality and local indigenous guides. The educational material was published in a web-portal that I implemented in [Drupal](//www.drupal.org).          |

Proigia still develops a web-based business intelligence platform and services for primary healthcare providers based on their own medical information. The application consists of data extraction, transport, anonymisation, encryption and reporting layers implemented in Python, Java, and PostgreSQL. The reporting front-end for clients was a web-application written in Turbogears and a web-mapping application implemented in OpenLayers/GeoExt/Geoserver/PostGIS. Data extraction, abstraction and interpretation were enormous challenges as data had to be extracted from 7 different IT systems from different companies, and were often very large and badly documented and had grown organically over many years. As CTO is was in charge of the technical strategy and architecture of the company, software development and implementation and IT infrastructure in general.         |

|2004 - 2013|Independent contractor in Elcyon.         |
|           |Starting out as a system administrator for various companies, work evolved into website and web-application development, and then on to software developer. The software development became the majority of work and after developing a proof-of-concept web-based GIS, culminated in the founding of Proigia. The last three years all work went into Proigia, with Elcyon taking a background position.            |
