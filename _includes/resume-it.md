### Summary
I am a software engineer with 15+ years experience at all levels of tech startups around the world, and for the past 5 years in the smart energy sector and IoT. I have designed and built proof of concept and MVP cloud (AWS and GCP) backends and IoT infrastructure (IP and LoRaWAN based), leading to a successful $19M Series A funding round for a Silicon Valley startup but also for grass-roots publicly funded products and projects. 
I understand the different strategies and challenges of getting a product to market.
My technical skillset on the backend, cloud and DevOps side focus on event driven and traditional restful architectures around Django, FastAPI Kubernetes and Terraform running on Linux or AWS and GCP clouds and LoRaWAN, MQTT, Losant and RabbitMQ on the IoT side, using a TDD approach, IaC and GitOps.
