### Summary

I am a software engineer with many years of experience and a strong affinity for IoT and hardware development. My main languages are Python, Typescript and embedded C, using TDD and CI/CD practices. I am very hands-on, and eager to jump into new challenges. My many years of experience have given me great breadth of knowledge, without sacrificing technical depth when necessary. As solutions architect, I love understanding problems properly both on the technical side and from a user's perspective. First and foremost I am an engineer, but am also very aware of the business consequences of engineering choices. In my last role at Therma, I designed the LoRaWAN IoT infrastructure for first their refrigeration monitoring platform, followed by the full back-end, machine learning pipeline, IoT architecture and hardware prototype integration for their energy product. These two led to them getting their $19M Series A funding, and resulted in two provisional patent applications.

|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2022 - 2023 |Solutions Architect at Therma, Cebu City, Cebu, The Philippines. |
|               |I was the technical lead in the architecture and initial development of the IoT infrastructure based on LoraWAN and RabbitMQ, NodeJS+Typescript back-end, machine learning pipeline (based on Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Python and Typescript) and prototype hardware integration of the HVACR energy product of Therma. This included technical collaboration with HVACR technicians and testing in the field in the US. I also collaborated heavily on two provisional patent applications, both regarding using the unique properties of refrigeration and HVAC systems to respond to dynamic energy demands and pricing from utility companies. This product was a major factor in Therma closing its $19M Series A funding.
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2019 - 2022 |Lead IoT Engineer at CoInspect Philippines Inc (dba Therma), Cebu City, Cebu, The Philippines. |
|               |For the Cebu office of San Francisco based startup [Therma](//www.hellotherma.com) I was the lead technical engineer in charge of the IoT architecture and development, including designing and implementing our LoRaWAN infrastructure and the integration of hardware into the back-end and hardware and firmware development. My responsibilities included technical supervision of a team of engineers, system architecture, integration of embedded and cloud based systems, firmware development, setting up hardware related DevOps automation and supporting our other teams as needed. I furthermore did the full design (schematic, PCB layout and CAD) for a prototype LoRaWAN gateway and a sensor.|
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2017 - 2019    |Consultant at College of Computer Studies at Foundation University, Dumaguete, The Philippines.           |
|               |At Foundation University I consulted on Software Development and IoT projects, taking the students along with me to teach them software development, rapid prototyping and electronics, and supervise their capstone and thesis projects. Most projects are were from the Nightowl Technology incubator. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Consultant
|               |I specialize in software development in Python. I furthermore consult on projects involving electronics, IoT, geospatial and data management, analysis and reporting. As my affinity with marine conservation, science and GIS is very strong, I enjoy applying my skills in this area most, but also derive a lot of satisfaction from purely technological challenges. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Partner at East Solar Works           |
|               |East Solar Works is a solar company that mainly focuses on new applications of solar power. It moved from regular solar power installations to solar water pumping for municipal and rural water supplies. As one of the partners, my main responsibilities were implementing ICT solutions, technical support and R&D and optimizing business processes. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2014 - 2016 |Science Officer at Marine Conservation Philippines|
|            |MCP is a non-profit nature conservation organization, funded by its volunteer program. My main responsibility was research and monitoring setup and execution, and supervision of interns and volunteers in those activities as well as coordination of conservation efforts with stakeholders. Later on my role shifted towards technical activities like data management and analysis, GIS and remote sensing.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2013 - 2014|Lecciones Amazonicas project coordinator at Amazon Fund, Bolivia|
|           |Coordination of an environmental education project in two consecutive secondary school years, in the Bolivian Amazon. Responsibilities included design and layout (in LateX) of educational material for a field practical and ecology course for secondary schools, and the coordination of the project with schools, teachers, directors, the municipality and local indigenous guides. The educational material was published in a web-portal that I implemented in Drupal.          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2010 - 2013|Chief Technical Officer at [Proigia](//www.proigia.nl)         |
|           |I co-founded Proigia with eventually 7 employees. Proigia developed a web-based business intelligence platform for primary healthcare providers in The Netherlands, based on their own medical information, including geospatial analyses and visualization. Important challenges were extracting and creating an abstraction layer of large and highly complex data from multiple 3rd party vendors, and making sense of the data. This was all done in close cooperation with the healthcare providers, and all with a privacy by design approach. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2004 - 2013|Independent contractor in Elcyon.         |
|           |Starting out as a system administrator for various companies, work evolved into website and web-application development, and then on to software development. The software development became the majority of work and after developing a proof-of-concept web-based GIS, culminated in the founding of Proigia.  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2001 - 2004|Various jobs at Wageningen University          |
|           |Including a system administrator at the head office, tutoring a course, development of a website for the Biology study, and development of information material for the health and safety department.           |
