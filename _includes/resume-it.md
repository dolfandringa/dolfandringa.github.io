### Summary

I am a software engineer with many years of experience and a strong affinity for IoT, hardware and embedded development. My main languages are Python, Typescript and embedded C, using TDD and CI/CD practices. I am very hands-on, and eager to jump into new challenges. My many years of experience have given me great breadth of knowledge, without sacrificing technical depth when necessary. As solutions architect, I love understanding problems properly both on the technical side and from a user's perspective. I love working as an engineer first, but am very aware of the business consequences of engineering choices. In my last role at Therma, I was was focused on new product development focused on commercial refrigeration, HVAC and the energy markets, which involved hardware development and designing and implementing a ML and backend infrastructure, all of which I took the technical lead on. My most essential skill in all of this is to be able to quickly analyze and understand a problem, both technical and practically. Once you do, solutions usually follow logically.

|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2022 - 2023 |Solutions Architect at Therma, Cebu City, Cebu, The Philippines. |
|               |Continuing my previous position, I was the technical lead in designing and initial development of new products and hardware prototypes for Therma. My main I worked on was the energy side of our Cooling Intelligence Platform, aimed at responding to climate change challenges presented by the energy consumption of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. This involved hardware hardware prototyping, design and implementation of our backend and ML infrastructure, integrating hardware into it and supporting the installation and testing of our hardware and software in the field. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2019 - 2022 |Lead IoT Engineer at CoInspect Philippines Inc (dba Therma), Cebu City, Cebu, The Philippines. |
|               |For the Cebu office of SF based startup [Therma](//www.hellotherma.com) I was the lead technical engineer in charge of the IoT architecture and development, including designing and implementing our LoRaWAN infrastructure and the integration of hardware into the back-end and hardware and firmware development. My responsibilities included technical supervision of a team of engineers, system architecture, integration of embedded and cloud based systems, firmware development, setting up hardware related DevOps automation and supporting our other teams as needed. I furthermore did the full design (schematic, PCB layout and CAD) for a prototype LoRaWAN gateway and a sensor.|
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2017 - 2019    |Consultant at College of Computer Studies at Foundation University, Dumaguete, The Philippines.           |
|               |For 3 days a week at Foundation University I consulted on Software Development and IoT projects, taking the students along with me to teach them software development, rapid prototyping and electronics, and supervise their capstone and thesis projects. Most projects are were from the Nightowl Technology incubator. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Consultant
|               |I specialize in software development in Python. I furthermore consult on projects involving electronics, IoT, geospatial and data management, analysis and reporting. As my affinity with marine conservation, science and GIS is very strong, I enjoy applying my skills in this area most, but also derive a lot of satisfaction from purely technological challenges. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Partner at East Solar Works           |
|               |East Solar Works is a solar company that mainly focuses on new applications of solar power. It moved from regular solar power installations to solar water pumping for municipal and rural water supplies. As one of the partners, my main responsibility is implementing ICT solutions, technical support and R&D and optimizing business processes. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2014 - 2016 |Science Officer at Marine Conservation Philippines|
|            |MCP is a non-profit nature conservation organization, funded by its volunteer program. My main responsibility was research and monitoring setup and execution, and supervision of interns and volunteers in those activities and coordination conservation efforts with stakeholders. Later on my role shifted more towards technical activities like data management and analysis, GIS and remote sensing.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2013 - 2014|Lecciones Amazonicas project coordinator at Amazon Fund, Bolivia|
|           |Coordination of an environmental education project in two consecutive secondary school years, in the Bolivian Amazon. Responsibilities included design and layout (in LateX) of educational material for a field practical and ecology course for secondary schools, and the coordination of the project with schools, teachers, directors, the municipality and local indigenous guides. The educational material was published in a web-portal that I implemented in Drupal.          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2010 - 2013|Chief Technical Officer at [Proigia](//www.proigia.nl)         |
|           |Continuing from my work at Elcyon, I co-founded Proigia. Eventually this became a company with about 7 employees that develops a web-based business intelligence platform for primary healthcare providers in The Netherlands, based on their own medical information. The application consists of data extraction, transformation, and analysis, focused on privacy by design, using encryption and data anonymisation. The applications were implemented in Python, Java, and PostgreSQL using the Turbogears framework and a web-mapping application implemented in OpenLayers/GeoExt/Geoserver/PostGIS. Data extraction, abstraction and interpretation were enormous challenges as data had to be extracted from 7 different IT systems from different companies, and were often very large and badly documented and had grown organically over many years. As CTO is was in charge of the technical strategy and architecture of the company, software development and implementation and IT infrastructure in general.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2004 - 2013|Independent contractor in Elcyon.         |
|           |Starting out as a system administrator for various companies, work evolved into website and web-application development, and then on to software developer. The software development became the majority of work and after developing a proof-of-concept web-based GIS, culminated in the founding of Proigia. The last three years all work went into Proigia, with Elcyon taking a background position.            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2001 - 2004|Various jobs at Wageningen University          |
|           |Including a system administrator at the head office, tutoring a course, development of a website for the Biology study, and development of information material for the health and safety department.           |
