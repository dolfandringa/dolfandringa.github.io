### Summary
I am a software engineer with 15+ years experience as technical lead and CTO of startups around the world, of which the past 8 years focused on the renewable energy sector and smart energy management. I like the complexities of the domestic energy markets and finding technical solutions to real world problems and opportunities. My core technical strengths are in systems architecture, IoT, backend development and DevOps in Python and Typescript, but I also have experience in GIS, embedded development, electronics prototyping and frontend development.
I speak my mind and collaborate well in teams where I can contribute my experience effectively. I have helped many startups through their initial startup phase, and have taken the technical lead in scaleups on various prototype software and hardware solutions, including one that lead to closing a $19M Series A funding. I assume people's intentions are good, and as a result have managed to deescalate professional conflicts between partners.
