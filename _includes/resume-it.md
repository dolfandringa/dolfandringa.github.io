|2016 - present |Technology and conservation consultant           |
|               |I specialise in full-stack software development in python. I furthermore consult on geo-spatial and scientific data management, analysis and reporting and implement technological solutions for marine ecosystem monitoring. As my affinity with marine conservation, science and GIS is very strong, this is my primary focus area, but my skill are equally applicable elsewhere. Although my main software development specialty is full-stack web-development in Python, I am versatile and have experience in Java, C, R and other languages.     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Partner at E.A.S.T. corp Philippines           |
|               |E.A.S.T. Corp Philippines implements technological solutions to promote a healthier environment. The main product is the use of solar energy in homes and small and medium sized businesses, off-grid installations, pumping systems and other innovative solutions. As one of the partners, my main responsibility is implementing ICT solutions, technical support and R&D and linking with conservation initiatives. My previous experience in building IT solutions, CTO of an IT company and in marine conservation come together in this role.          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2014 - 2016|Science Officer at Marine Conservation Philippines|
|           |MCP is a non-profit nature conservation organisation, funded by its volunteer program. It supports conservation initiatives by the local government and conservation and peoples' organisations with technical knowledge and trained manpower. My main responsibility was research and monitoring setup and execution, and supervision of interns and volunteers in those activities and coordination with stakeholders. Later on my role shifted more towards techn(olog)ical activities like data management and analysis, GIS and remote sensing activities and IT and spatial data infrastructure management. As part of the scientific monitoring program, I also developed our own data entry (web-)application in AngularJS/Python/PostgreSQL. Since I work as independent consultant, MCP is still one of my clients.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2013 - 2014|Lecciones Amazonicas project coordinator at Amazon Fund, Bolivia|
|           |Coordination of an environmental education project in two consecutive secondary school years, in the Bolivian Amazon. Responsibilities included design and layout (in LateX) of educational material for a field practical and ecology course for secondary schools, and the coordination of the project with schools, teachers, directors, the municipality and local indigenous guides. The educational material was published in a web-portal that I implemented in [Drupal](//www.drupal.org).          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2010 - 2013|Chief Technical Officer at [Proigia](//www.proigia.nl)         |
|           |As a continuation of my work at Elcyon, I co-founded Proigia. It grew into a company with about 7 employees. Proigia still develops a web-based business intelligence platform and services for primary healthcare providers based on their own medical information. The application consists of data extraction, transport, anonymisation, encryption and reporting layers implemented in Python, Java, and PostgreSQL. The reporting front-end for clients was a web-application written in Turbogears and a web-mapping application implemented in OpenLayers/GeoExt/Geoserver/PostGIS. Data extraction, abstraction and interpretation were enormous challenges as data had to be extracted from 7 different IT systems from different companies, and were often very large and badly documented and had grown organically over many years. As CTO is was in charge of the technical strategy and architecture of the company, software development and implementation and IT infrastructure in general.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2004 - 2013|Independent contractor in Elcyon.         |
|           |Starting out as a system administrator for various companies, work evolved into website and web-application development, and then on to software developer. The software development became the majority of work and after developing a proof-of-concept web-based GIS, culminated in the founding of Proigia. The last three years all work went into Proigia, with Elcyon taking a background position.            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2001 - 2004|Various jobs at Wageningen University          |
|           |Including a system administrator at the head office, tutoring a course, development of a website for the Biology study, and development of information material for the health and safety department.           |
