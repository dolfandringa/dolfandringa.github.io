|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2022 - present |Solutions Architect at Therma, Cebu City, Cebu, The Philippines. |
|               |Evolving from my previous position I was put in charge of designing and technical leadership of initial development of new products and hardware prototypes for Therma, designing technical solutions that involved ML, back-end, DevOps, and hardware integration. The main product I worked on was our cooling intelligence platform, aimed at responding to climate change challenges presented by the energy consumption of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.|
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2019 - 2022 |Lead IoT Engineer at CoInspect Philippines Inc (dba Therma), Cebu City, Cebu, The Philippines. |
|               |For the Cebu office of San Fransisco based startup Therma (hellotherma.com) I was the technical lead engineer in charge of the IoT architecture and development, including designing and implementing our LoRaWAN infrastructure and the integration of hardware into the back-end and hardware and firmware development. My responsibilities included technical supervision of a team of engineers, system architecture, integration of embedded and cloud based systems, firmware development, electronics design of prototypes, setting up devops automation and supporting our other teams as needed. I furthermore did the electronics design and PCB design for a prototype LoRaWAN gateway and sensor.|
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2017 - 2019    |Consultant at College of Computer Studies at Foundation University, Dumaguete, The Philippines.           |
|               |For 3 days a week at Foundation University I consulted on Software Development and IoT projects, taking the students along with me to teach them software development, rapid prototyping and electronics, and supervise their capstone and thesis projects. Most projects are were from the Nightowl Technology incubator. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Consultant
|               |I specialize in software development in Python, Angular and Ionic. I furthermore consult on projects involving electronics, IoT, geospatial and scientific data management, analysis and reporting. As my affinity with marine conservation, science and GIS is very strong, I enjoy applying my skills in this area most, but also derive a lot of satisfaction from purely technological challenges. |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2016 - present |Partner at East Solar Works           |
|               |East Solar Works is a solar company that mainly focuses on new applications of solar power. It moved from regular solar power installations to solar water pumping for municipal and rural water supplies. As one of the partners, my main responsibility is implementing ICT solutions, technical support and R&D and optimizing business processes. My previous experience in building IT solutions and as CTO of an IT company come together in this role.          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2014 - 2016 |Science Officer at Marine Conservation Philippines|
|            |MCP is a non-profit nature conservation organization, funded by its volunteer program. It supports conservation initiatives by the local government and conservation and peoples' organizations with technical knowledge and trained manpower. My main responsibility was research and monitoring setup and execution, and supervision of interns and volunteers in those activities and coordination with stakeholders. Later on my role shifted more towards techn(olog)ical activities like data management and analysis, GIS and remote sensing activities and IT and spatial data infrastructure management. As part of the scientific monitoring program, I also developed our own data entry (web-)application in AngularJS/Python/PostgreSQL. Since I work as independent consultant, MCP is still one of my clients.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2013 - 2014|Lecciones Amazonicas project coordinator at Amazon Fund, Bolivia|
|           |Coordination of an environmental education project in two consecutive secondary school years, in the Bolivian Amazon. Responsibilities included design and layout (in LateX) of educational material for a field practical and ecology course for secondary schools, and the coordination of the project with schools, teachers, directors, the municipality and local indigenous guides. The educational material was published in a web-portal that I implemented in [Drupal](//www.drupal.org).          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2010 - 2013|Chief Technical Officer at [Proigia](//www.proigia.nl)         |
|           |As a continuation of my work at Elcyon, I co-founded Proigia. It grew into a company with about 7 employees. Proigia still develops a web-based business intelligence platform and services for primary healthcare providers based on their own medical information. The application consists of data extraction, transport, anonymisation, encryption and reporting layers implemented in Python, Java, and PostgreSQL. The reporting front-end for clients was a web-application written in Turbogears and a web-mapping application implemented in OpenLayers/GeoExt/Geoserver/PostGIS. Data extraction, abstraction and interpretation were enormous challenges as data had to be extracted from 7 different IT systems from different companies, and were often very large and badly documented and had grown organically over many years. As CTO is was in charge of the technical strategy and architecture of the company, software development and implementation and IT infrastructure in general.         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2004 - 2013|Independent contractor in Elcyon.         |
|           |Starting out as a system administrator for various companies, work evolved into website and web-application development, and then on to software developer. The software development became the majority of work and after developing a proof-of-concept web-based GIS, culminated in the founding of Proigia. The last three years all work went into Proigia, with Elcyon taking a background position.            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|2001 - 2004|Various jobs at Wageningen University          |
|           |Including a system administrator at the head office, tutoring a course, development of a website for the Biology study, and development of information material for the health and safety department.           |
