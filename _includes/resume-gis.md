### Summary
I am an experienced software engineer with a strong affinity for (and MSc minor in) GIS and IoT. My main languages are Python and Typescript, and I have experience developing with many different web development frameworks, using TDD and CI/CD practices. I am very hands-on, and eager to explore new technologies. My experience has given me breadth of knowledge, without sacrificing technical depth. As solutions architect, I love understanding problems both on the technical side and from a user's perspective. First and foremost I am an engineer, but I am also very aware of the business consequences of engineering choices. I have contributed to multiple Open Source software products, including the original Geoalchemy plugin (now deprecated) for Flask Appbuilder. In my last role at Therma, I designed the full back-end infrastructure and machine learning pipeline for two products in commercial refrigeration and HVAC energy management. These led to them closing their $19M Series A funding, and resulted in two provisional patent applications. For my own startup, and as consultant I have developed a web-based GIS application and done data analysis and GIS work for healthcare providers and nature conservation projects across the world.
