                <p>I live and have setup the IT infrastructure for an NGO where I share my living space with volunteers. Generally the volunteers are hard workers and well behaved, but once every while on a Saturday night they are having a good time, which often involves turning the music up just a little too high. As I am usually already in my own little house a few 10’s of meters away, I don’t always share their enjoyment. But I don’t want to nag them and am also way too lazy to go out and turn the music down. As the computer they use to play the music on runs Linux Mint and I can access it from my home through the wifi, I thought I’d create a script that allows me to change the volume on the computer remotely.</p>

                        <p>I love Gnome Music Player Client (gmpc) as an audio player, with MPD (Music Player Daemon) as a backend. Both because of the remote control possibilities but GMPC is also just a great client. But when installing MPD, combined with PulseAudio on my Arch Linux laptop, I ran into trouble. MPD runs as a different user, and as that user wasn’t able to connect to PulseAudio that runs under my regular desktop user.</p>

                        <p>Recently I have been analyzing a large amount of data with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. A great tool to do this is <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>. It is an IDE for R that makes it easy to write your R code, explore the data and show the graphs. But if you want to communicate your results with others, sitting behind an IDE isn’t the best way. Fortunately Rstudio integrates with Knitr, RMarkdown and Pandoc. With those tools you can create PDF, HTML or word files from your R code.</p>

                        <p>I am running Arch Linux for a while now and am quite happy with it. Even though it is not the easiest n00b distro, in the end the documentation is so good that if you’re new to Linux, you can probably find out how to do most stuff if you’re inquisitive. One thing I had trouble with though, is getting a custom Live CD that could boot from my USB drive, has a persistence layer so changes are saved when booting, and booted both from UEFI only systems (my laptop) and preferably also BIOS only systems. It took me a while to figure this out, but I got it in the end. So I’ll document it for posterity.</p>

                        <p>For this post I want to share some of my favorite web-application development tools. When I started thinking about this though, I realized there were so many, and which I use depends so much on what it is that I am trying to do, that I decided to take maybe a somewhat strange approach to this. I am going to approach it as a comparison on two sets of tools: python web development tools vs php CMS-es.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Over the years I have wondered why researchers still rely on spreadsheet applications to record their research data. Although most people know how to use them, spreadsheets have very serious drawbacks, especially if multiple people contribute data to the same dataset/project. With spreadsheets it is usually not possible to have multiple people enter data concurrently. It is also hard to check the sanity of entered data unless you start working with complex formulas and macros, which quickly become very complex, error prone and hard to maintain. And lastly, transforming data in a spreadsheet where you combine data from different tabs/tables, transpose data, filter/sort data, group/split data, etc becomes hard and error prone. For these (and more) reasons, (relational) databases with a decent data entry application in front of it are much better suited for research data.</p>

                        <p>Over the years I have (happily) setup and used many different ways of hosting personal and company email and websites from <a href="https://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a>, commercially hosted virtual servers, in-house servers, cheap webhosting companies, servers at home and blogs and websites in <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.drupal.com">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, etc. All of them have their merits and drawbacks. But since I moved to the Philippines and started working for <a href="http://www.marineconservationphilippines.org">Marine Conservation Philippines</a> I was looking for something cheap (free?) and low-maintenance to host the email from my old domain name, and host a weblog for personal ramblings. This is what I ended up with.</p>
