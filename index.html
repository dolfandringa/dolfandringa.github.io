                <p>Since a few weeks my laptop battery is dead. I am still trying to work with Asus to get a new one as it is still under warranty (but sending it in for repair will apparently take 2 months while I already know that a new battery will solve the problem). So I am working of the net power only. The power sockets in the Philippines aren’t great though, and Asus decided to integrate the plug into the transformer/regulator unit for my laptop charger, creating a big heavy plug that is really too heavy for vertical wall sockets. So as you can guess from the title of this blog post, yesterday I was working on my laptop and decided to install upgrades on my Arch Linux box. While I was doing this though, I accidentally touched the power cord of my laptop, which then fell out of the wall socket. This isn’t the first time this happened, but unfortunately my computer was in the middle of a kernel upgrade…. And of course the kernel modules weren’t fully installed, and the initramfs wasn’t fully updated either.</p>

                        <p>This post is probably a no-brainer for quite a lot of people. And it should have been for me too. I don’t know if my brain was just not working from the dry and hot el niño weather, but it took me quite a while to figure this out. Since chances are there are others with the same problem, I thought it’d be worth to write it up.</p>

                        <p>The USGS isn’t just a scientific organisation doing a lot of satellite imagery and remote sensing work. They show themselves to be artists as well. These images are absolutely gorgeous. Earth itself is gorgeous and there are many ways of looking at it. The way the USGS Landsat team are looking at it is definitely way out there. The way I use the same images to try to look underwater is a bit more mundane unfortunately.
These are just some of the images. You can <a href="http://eros.usgs.gov/imagegallery/earth-art-4">see more on the USGS website</a>.</p>

                        <p>Little by little I am working at my current job on an <a href="http://www.theaquaponicsource.com/what-is-aquaponics/">Aquaponics system</a> together with the help of our volunteers.
As a final step to the first implementation I need to regulate the flow of water from our fish tank to the grow bed. I decided to do this with a timer that switches the pump on and off. In order to create the electronics for this timer, I need to know accurately how much water is flowing from one compartment into the next.
Of course I could just have done the maths for this on the back of a napkin, but I though writing an application that does the simulation would be much more fun.
And as it turns out, one thing leads to another, and before you know it you have a complete desktop application with <a href="http://allican.be/AquaponicsModeler/">proper documentation</a> that can be used by anyone. It was fun to do and is helping me create our own aquaponics setup. I don’t know if it is of any use to anyone else, but for anyone interested, the documentation can be found <a href="http://allican.be/AquaponicsModeler/">on my website</a> and the code on <a href="http://www.github.com/dolfandringa/AquaponicsModeler/">Github</a>.</p>

                        <p>I love Gnome Music Player Client (gmpc) as an audio player, with MPD (Music Player Daemon) as a backend. Both because of the remote control possibilities but GMPC is also just a great client. But when installing MPD, combined with PulseAudio on my Arch Linux laptop, I ran into trouble. MPD runs as a different user, and as that user wasn’t able to connect to PulseAudio that runs under my regular desktop user.</p>

                        <p>Recently I have been analyzing a large amount of data with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. A great tool to do this is <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>. It is an IDE for R that makes it easy to write your R code, explore the data and show the graphs. But if you want to communicate your results with others, sitting behind an IDE isn’t the best way. Fortunately Rstudio integrates with Knitr, RMarkdown and Pandoc. With those tools you can create PDF, HTML or word files from your R code.</p>

                        <p>I am running Arch Linux for a while now and am quite happy with it. Even though it is not the easiest n00b distro, in the end the documentation is so good that if you’re new to Linux, you can probably find out how to do most stuff if you’re inquisitive. One thing I had trouble with though, is getting a custom Live CD that could boot from my USB drive, has a persistence layer so changes are saved when booting, and booted both from UEFI only systems (my laptop) and preferably also BIOS only systems. It took me a while to figure this out, but I got it in the end. So I’ll document it for posterity.</p>

When I started thinking about this though, I realized there were so many, and which I use depends so much on what it is that I am trying to do, that I decided to take maybe a somewhat strange approach to this. I am going to approach it as a comparison on two sets of tools: python web development tools vs php CMS-es.</p>

                        <p>Over the years I have wondered why researchers still rely on spreadsheet applications to record their research data. Although most people know how to use them, spreadsheets have very serious drawbacks, especially if multiple people contribute data to the same dataset/project. With spreadsheets it is usually not possible to have multiple people enter data concurrently. It is also hard to check the sanity of entered data unless you start working with complex formulas and macros, which quickly become very complex, error prone and hard to maintain. And lastly, transforming data in a spreadsheet where you combine data from different tabs/tables, transpose data, filter/sort data, group/split data, etc becomes hard and error prone. For these (and more) reasons, (relational) databases with a decent data entry application in front of it are much better suited for research data.</p>
